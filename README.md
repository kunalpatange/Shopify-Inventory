# Shopify-Inventory
This is a test project what has basic functionality of an inventory of a store

This project  has implemented *"Push a button export product data to a CSV"* feature.

### Requirements:

- Python3
- flask && flask-sqlalchemy

### Installation:

> git clone https://github.com/kunalpatange/Shopify-Inventory.git

> cd Shopify-Inventory
 
> pip3 install flask flask-sqlalchemy

Note: pip or pip3 anything what is compatible with python3 works.

Make sure we create the database, for that follow the below steps in the same directory:
```
$ python3
Python 3.8.10 (default, Nov 26 2021, 20:14:08) 
[GCC 9.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from app import db
/home/user/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/flask_sqlalchemy/__init__.py:872: FSADeprecationWarning: SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS adds significant overhead and will be disabled by default in the future.  Set it to True or False to suppress this warning.
  warnings.warn(FSADeprecationWarning(
>>> db.create_all()
>>> exit()
```
The above step will result in the creation of file "data.db" in same directory as app.py

Now run the app.py 
> $ python3 app.py 

```
output:
/home/kunal/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/flask_sqlalchemy/__init__.py:872: FSADeprecationWarning: SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS adds significant overhead and will be disabled by default in the future.  Set it to True or False to suppress this warning.
